(geometrical) n-simplex : convex set spanned by n+1 independent points V (vertices)

faces : convex sets spanned by W subset of V

(geometrical) simplicial complex : set of simplices stable by face and such that every intersection is a face.
Entirely defined by the collections of vertices that form a simplex.
We can separate them by the dimension of the simplexe : X_0...X_k

abstract simplicial complex : sets of vertices X_0...X_k verifying the property that each subset of X_k of size j+1 is in X_j (face of a k-1-simplex)


abstract lose size and embedding information but keep combinatorial information (up to homeomorphism)

simplicial maps (morphisms over simplicial complex) : if [v_0...v_k] is a simplex, then [f(v_0)...f(v_k)] too [eventually with repetition]
Entirely defined by the image of X_0
Ex : inclusion, collapse

ordered simplex : same with ordered vertices, noted \vert \Delta^n \vert
Extension of ordering to ordered simplicial complex

face map d_i : remove vertex i. map to a face. Ordered simplices needed.
Any face can be recovered by a composition of face maps.
It verifies the propery i<j -> d_i d_j = d_{j-1} d_i (*)

Delta sets : Any sets X_0 ... X_n with functions d_i X_n+1 -> X_n verifying the same property as face maps
An other example than simplicial complex : cone obtained by gluing two edges of a 2-simplex.
Main generalisation : allows two distinct elements to have the same set of vertices.

A delta set can be seen as a couple (X,d), where X are standards simplices and d the face maps of those simplices.


CATEGORY \hat \Delta
strict order homomorphism from [m] to [n] = way to embed the standard ordered m-simplex in the standard ordered n-simplex
morphism in the opposite category are exactly face maps. th property (*) can be easily verified

Delta sets characterised as COVARIANT functor \DELTA^op -> SET : F(n) = X_n and F(m->n) gives the face maps

Delta maps (morphisms over delta sets) : Natural transformation from F to G, that is (F_n -> G_n)_{n \in N} commuting with face maps.





Interlude
Soit X = <triangle> = <0,1,2> et  Y=<arête>=<0,1>.
Foncteur FX
FX([0]) = {[0],[1],[2]}
FX([1]) = {[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]}
FX([2]) = {[0,1,2}
FX(p n->m ) = fonction qui a chaque n-simplexe associe sa projection selon les sommets de p
Foncteur GY
GY([0]) = {[0],[1]}
GY([1]) = {[0,1]}



Considerons l'effondrement du triangle sur l'arete. [simplicial map]
Pour que ce morphisme soit un delta map, il faut pour n=0,1,2 une flèche de FX_n -> GY_n
Passer d'un delta set à un autre c'est passer de X_n a Y_n donc de FX([n]) à GY([n])
En particulier, il faut que chaque X_n se transforme en Y_n


Degeneracy Simplices : Still ordered, but not necessarily unique.
Cone : pi([0,1,2) = [0,1,1]

Degeneracy maps : Converse of face maps
s_j = [0 ... j j ... n]
Property : If i<=j then s_i s_j = s_{j+1} s_i

Relation betwzzn Degeneracy maps and Face maps
d_i s_j = s_{j-1} d_i if i<j
d_js_j = d_{j+1} s_j = id
d_i s_j = s_j d_{i-1} if i>	j+1

Simplicial set : Any sets X_0 ... X_n with functions d_i X_n+1 -> X_n and s_i X_n -> X_n+1
verifying properties of face maps and degeneracy maps
Each ordered simplicial complex or Delta set can be easily extended
Each simplicial sets can forget its degeneracy maps to become a delta set

Ex : X topologic space, S(X)n continuous function \vert \Delta_n \vert -> X i.e ordered n-simplex -> X.
Then S(X)n  is a simplicial set, called singular set of X. (a shortcut for the image of X by S(X)_n)
SINGULAR CHAIN COMPLEX = Abelian_Free(S(X)_n)
A singular simplex is an element of the singular set (\sigma or \sigma(X))
We can easily define the faces of the singular simplex and a degenerated one.
	

Nondegenerate simplex : cant be written s_i(y) with y \in X_{n-1}
-> S(X)_n is nondegenerate if it cannot be collapsed first then sent to a singular simplex.




CATEGORY \Delta
order homomorphism from [m] to [n] = way to embed the standard ordered m-simplex in the standard ordered n-simplex
Difference with category of delta sets : function not necessarely increasing (can be non-decreasing)
Now, morphisms can be either opposite of face maps or degeneracy maps. [inclusion or collapses]

In the same fashion, simplicial sets characterised as COVARIANT functor \DELTA^op -> SET : F(n) = X_n and F(m->n) gives the face/degeneracy maps
Simplicial morphisms are natural transformations between two functors representing simplicial sets.
That is, a simplicial morphism is a collection (f_n : X_n -> Y_n) commuting with face and degeneracy operators.
We can define simplicial morphisms from simplicial maps.
However, morphisms are not characterized by the image of the vertices (If the resulting simplicial set has two edges between the same vertices..)


Back from combinatorics to geometry/topology

Realisation of a simplicial set : \vert X \vert = \prod X_n \times \vert \Delta_n \vert \\ \sim
The cartesian product of each simplex with the standard simplex of same dimension is quotiented to match faces and degeneracies.
Realisaction of a simplicial set does not always match realisation of its subsequent delta set obtained by omitting the structure
However they are HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENT, whatever this means.

What is a CW complex topological space ?

A degenerate simplex is a degeneracy of a unique degenerate simplex

Realisation of a simplicial set is a CW complex with one cell for each non-degenerate n-simplex of X.


The realiation functor is adjoint to the singular set functor S
